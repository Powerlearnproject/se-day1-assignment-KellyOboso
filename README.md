-Ensures Reliability through proper Software Engineering practices that lead to more reliable and stable software, reducing the likelihood of crashes, errors, and system failures which is crucial for critical applications in healthcare, transportation, and finance.
-Rapid Development and Iteration by the use of modern Software Engineering methodologies, such as Agile and DevOps, enable rapid development and iterative improvements, ensuring that software can keep up with evolving user needs. 
-Software Engineering enforces coding standards and best practices, promoting consistency and making it easier for different developers to work on the same project. 
-Interdisciplinary Integration whereby Software Engineering often involves collaboration with other fields, such as hardware engineering, to ensure seamless integration of software with various systems and components.
-Security is a fundamental aspect of Software Engineering whereby it emphasizes the identification and mitigation of security vulnerabilities, protecting software from cyber threats. 



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
i)SE Era I: Mastering Machine(1956-1967)
-Code development was strongly influenced by outside forces. The main purpose of any piece of software was to optimize the exploitation of the limited hardware resources. The first compilers were defined; operating systems were non-interactive. These primitive environments continued evolving up to the definition of the first low-level Computer Aided Software Engineering tools facilitating interactive editing, compiling, and debugging. The lack of software development methods led to high risk and the origin of a new stage is easily noticeable.
ii)SE Era II: Mastering the Process (1968–1982). 
-The First software crisis in this stage led to the birth of software engineering. The aim was to reduce risk during development and improve quality and productivity. Software development methodologies appeared to define and monitor software building. An important contribution of this stage was the formal modeling approach that enables implementation automation. However, for industry, this formal approach was unfeasible due to a lack of tools and training. Furthermore, formal methods become unmanageable for large system development. In conclusion, in this stage, the need to focus on predesign phases and the use of more or less formal models for software specification began to appear. Several structured methods, such as Software Requirement Engineering Methodology (SREM) and the Structured Analysis and Design Technique (SADT) were developed allowing the development of specification documents for business management software
iii)SE Era III: Mastering the Complexity (1983–1992). 
The up to then dominion of hardware over software ended. Personal computers arrived and opened the fields of computer applications. The software development process would now comprehensively address analysis and design from the specification. Graphical user interface and visual programming brought software closer to customers. The use of structured family and data modeling methodologies was extended. Several CASE tools facilitated software development. However, data modeling (database) and function modeling(structured methods) still followed separate paths. This approach enables efficient reuse of object-oriented software and thus improves building software productivity.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Phase 1: Planning
-It involves defining the software's purpose and scope
Phase 2:Requirement Analysis
-Requirements Analysis seeks to identify and record the precise requirements of the final users.
Phase 3:Design
-The Design phase is all about building the framework. The development team is responsible for software engineering and outlines the software's functionality and aesthetic.
Phase 4:Coding
-This development phase aims to develop software that is functional, efficient, and user-friendly. Developers use an appropriate programming language, Java or otherwise, to write the code, guided by the SDD and coding guidelines. 
Phase 5:Testing
-Software testing involves a thorough examination of the software for any bugs or glitches that might have slipped through during coding. The aim is to ensure flawless software operation before it reaches the end-users. And even identify opportunities for enhancement.
Phase 6:Deployment
-The Deployment phase involves rolling out the meticulously tested and fine-tuned software to its end-users.
Phase 7:Maintenance
-the maintenance phase is characterized by constant assistance and improvement, which guarantees the software's best possible functioning and longevity and ensures it meets customer expectations.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-In agile methodology, testing is done incrementally while in the waterfall methodology testing is done all together.
-In agile methodology changes are implemented incrementally and in small pieces	while in Waterfall methodology implementation works by Pivoting from one task to another until all planned changes are created.
-In agile methodology deployment is done using gradual, iterative methods, like canary releases while in Waterfall methodology	deployment is done cautiously since deployment risk increases with a complex set of changes.
-In agile methodology analysis works by breaking work into discrete, easily managed tasks while in Waterfall method analysis	works to implement changes defined at a high level
-In agile methodology there is a focus on modular system designs and interfaces	while in waterfall methodology there is no specific approach to system design

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-Prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative artificial intelligence solutions to generate desired outputs.

It's importance in interacting with AI models
-It ensures that churned-out outputs have context and are intended accordingly. This increases the level of practicality and excellence of implemented AI-based text products in different spheres.
-Prompt engineering approaches can be used across various text generation tasks and domains, making them essential for content generation, language translation, summary, and other broad range of applications.
-Prompt engineering is all about creating a suitable basis for designing AI-driven products, considering a customer’s needs, tastes, and targeted group. That is the good side of flexibility, as it facilitates modifying content to fit the person’s particular goals and targets.
-Prompt engineering fosters user control over AI by allowing users to control the AI models themselves with prompts. This, in turn, ensures that the most generated content closely matches the user’s needs and expectations.
-Effective prompts help develop an AI targeted in its approach to text generation through proper direction on specific tasks or topics. This automation is beneficial as it increases efficiency and reduces the need for manual involvement. Hence, time and resources are saved by optimizing the process downstream.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-Vague Prompt: "Write about a historical event."
-Improved, Clear, Specific, and Concise Prompt: "Write a 500-word essay on the migration of the bantu, focusing on its movement into East Africa."

why the improved prompt is more effective:
-Clarity: The improved prompt clearly specifies the topic to be discussed: the migration of the Bantu. This clarity helps the writer understand exactly what event to focus on, eliminating any ambiguity.
-Specificity: The prompt is specific about the aspects to cover: the movement of the Bantu. This specificity guides the writer on what content to include, making it easier to structure the essay and ensuring that the response is directly relevant to the topic.
-Conciseness: The prompt is concise, providing all necessary details without unnecessary information. This conciseness ensures that the writer knows the scope of the task without being overwhelmed or confused by extraneous details.
-Focus on Impact: By directing the writer to focus on the impact on the movement into East Africa, the prompt narrows the scope further, making it manageable and ensuring that the essay will have a clear, coherent theme.
-Word Count: The prompt specifies a word count (500 words), which helps the writer understand the expected length and depth of the essay. This constraint encourages the writer to be precise and thoughtful in their analysis.
-Guidance for Research: The improved prompt implicitly guides the writer on what areas to research, such as the political, social, and economic changes resulting from the migration of the Bantu. This guidance saves time and ensures that the research is targeted and efficient
